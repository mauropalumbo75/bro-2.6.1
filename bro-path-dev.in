# After configured by CMake, this file prints the absolute path to Bro scripts
# that come with the source distributions of Bro as well as scripts that are
# generated by the BIF compiler at compile time.
#
# The intended use of this script is to make it easier to run Bro from
# the build directory, avoiding the need to install it.  This could be
# done like:
#
#     BROPATH=`./bro-path-dev` ./src/bro
