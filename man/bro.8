.SH NAME
bro \- passive network traffic analyzer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bro
\/\fP [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIfile\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bro is primarily a security monitor that inspects all traffic on a link in
depth for signs of suspicious activity. More generally, however, Bro
supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks even outside of the
security domain, including performance measurements and helping with
trouble-shooting.

Bro comes with built-in functionality for a range of analysis and detection
tasks, including detecting malware by interfacing to external registries,
reporting vulnerable versions of software seen on the network, identifying
popular web applications, detecting SSH brute-forcing, validating SSL
certificate chains, among others.
