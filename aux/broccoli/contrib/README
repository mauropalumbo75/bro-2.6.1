This directory contains code contributed by others, until it's clear
where's the best place to put it.

Note: given broccoli-config, the generic build command for a Broccoli
application is

  $ <compiler> -o output <source files> `broccoli-config --cflags` \
  `broccoli-config --libs`

					        --Christian.
