Usage
=====

There aren't really any useful docs yet.  Your best bet currently is
to read through the examples.

One thing I should mention however is that I haven't done any optimization
yet.  You may find that if you write code that is going to be sending or
receiving extremely large numbers of events, that it won't run fast enough and
will begin to fall behind the Bro server.  The dns_requests.rb example is
a good performance test if your Bro server is sitting on a network with many
dns lookups.
