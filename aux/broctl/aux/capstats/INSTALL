Prerequisites
=============

capstats relies on the following libraries and tools, which need to be
installed before you begin:

    * A C++ compiler

    * Libpcap headers and libraries
       Network traffic capture library

    * CMake 2.6.3 or greater
       CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system, typically
       not installed by default.  See http://www.cmake.org for more
       information regarding CMake and the installation steps below for
       how to use it to build this distribution.  CMake generates native
       Makefiles that depend on GNU Make by default.

Installation
============

To build and install into /usr/local:

    > ./configure
    > make
    > make install

This will perform an out-of-source build into the build directory using
the default build options and then install the capstats binary into
/usr/local/bin.
