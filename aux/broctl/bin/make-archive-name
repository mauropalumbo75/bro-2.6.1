#! /usr/bin/env bash
#
# Returns a path where a log file will be archived. This script is called
# once for each log file being archived. Usage is:
#
# make-archive-name <origname> <writer> <timestamp-when-opened> [<timestamp-when-closed>]
#
# Example:
# make-archive-name conn.log ascii 2015-01-20-15-48-23 2015-01-20-16-00-00
#
# Example output:
# 2015-01-20/conn.15:48:23-16:00:00.log
#
#   origname: The original name of the log file being archived (e.g. conn.log).
#   writer:   The name of the log writer type that produced the file.
#   timestamp-when-opened: The timestamp when the log file being archived was
#                          created.
#   timestamp-when-closed: The timestamp when the log file being archived was
#                          finished.  Optional.  If not given, the path is used
#                          by another script to create a link to the current
#                          live version of the file.
#
# The writer is derived from the WRITER_* constants and lower-cased; e.g.,
# "ascii" for Log::WRITER_ASCII.
#
# Times are given in the form "year-month-day-hour-minute-second",
# e.g., "2010-03-30-13-12-04"
#
# The script must return the path under which the file should be
# archived.  A relative path will be interpreted as
# relative to BroControl's standard log directory.
#
# Note that even if the logs will later be compressed, this script should
# always return the filename without any compression extension (such as ".gz");
# that extension will be appended later.
