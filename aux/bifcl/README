Bro BIF Compiler
================

The ``bifcl`` program simply takes a ``.bif`` file as input and
generates C++ header/source files along with a ``.bro`` script
that all-together provide the declaration and implementation of Bro_
Built-In-Functions (BIFs), which can then be compiled and shipped
as part of a Bro plugin.

A BIF allows one to write arbitrary C++ code and access it via a
function call inside a Bro script.  In this way, they can also be
used to access parts of Bro's internal C++ API that aren't already
exposed via their own BIFs.

At the moment, learning the format of a ``.bif`` file is likely easiest
by just taking a look at the ``.bif`` files inside the Bro source-tree.
