## Generated for every new connection. This event is raised with the first
## packet of a previously unknown connection. Bro uses a flow-based definition
## of "connection" here that includes not only TCP sessions but also UDP and
## ICMP flows.
global new_connection: event(c: connection );
## Generated when a TCP connection timed out. This event is raised when
## no activity was seen for an interval of at least
## :bro:id:`tcp_connection_linger`, and either one endpoint has already
## closed the connection or one side never became active.
global connection_timeout: event(c: connection );
## Generated when a connection's internal state is about to be removed from
## memory. Bro generates this event reliably once for every connection when it
## is about to delete the internal state. As such, the event is well-suited for
## script-level cleanup that needs to be performed for every connection.  This
## event is generated not only for TCP sessions but also for UDP and ICMP
## flows.
