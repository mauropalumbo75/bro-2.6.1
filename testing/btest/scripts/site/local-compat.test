# This tests the compatibility of the past release's site/local.bro
# script with the current version of Bro.  If the test fails because
# it doesn't find the right file, that means everything stayed
# compatibile between releases, so just add a TEST-START-FILE with
# the contents the latest Bro version's site/local.bro script.
# If the test fails while loading the old local.bro, it usually
# indicates a note will need to be made in NEWS explaining to users
# how to migrate to the new version and this test's TEST-START-FILE
# should be updated with the latest contents of site/local.bro.
