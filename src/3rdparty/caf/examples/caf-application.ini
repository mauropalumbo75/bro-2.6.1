; This file shows all possible parameters with defaults.
; Values enclosed in <> are detected at runtime unless defined by the user.

; when using the default scheduler
[scheduler]
; accepted alternative: 'sharing'
policy='stealing'
; configures whether the scheduler generates profiling output
enable-profiling=false
; forces a fixed number of threads if set
max-threads=<number of cores>
; maximum number of messages actors can consume in one run
max-throughput=<infinite>
; measurement resolution in milliseconds (only if profiling is enabled)
profiling-resolution=100ms
; output file for profiler data (only if profiling is enabled)

; when using 'stealing' as scheduler policy
[work-stealing]
; number of zero-sleep-interval polling attempts
aggressive-poll-attempts=100
; frequency of steal attempts during aggressive polling
aggressive-steal-interval=10
; number of moderately aggressive polling attempts
moderate-poll-attempts=500
; frequency of steal attempts during moderate polling
moderate-steal-interval=5
; sleep interval between poll attempts
moderate-sleep-duration=50us
; frequency of steal attempts during relaxed polling
relaxed-steal-interval=1
; sleep interval between poll attempts

; when loading io::middleman
[middleman]
; configures whether MMs try to span a full mesh
enable-automatic-connections=false
; application identifier of this node, prevents connection to other CAF
; instances with different identifier
app-identifier=""
; maximum number of consecutive I/O reads per broker
max-consecutive-reads=50
; heartbeat message interval in ms (0 disables heartbeating)
heartbeat-interval=0ms
; configures whether the MM attaches its internal utility actors to the
; scheduler instead of dedicating individual threads (needed only for
; deterministic testing)
attach-utility-actors=false
; configures whether the MM starts a background thread for I/O activity,
; setting this to true allows fully deterministic execution in unit test and
; requires the user to trigger I/O manually
manual-multiplexing=false
; disables communication via TCP
disable-tcp=false
; enable communication via UDP
enable-udp=false

; when compiling with logging enabled
[logger]
; file name template for output log file files (empty string disables logging)

; format for rendering individual log file entries
file-format="%r %c %p %a %t %C %M %F:%L %m%n"

console='none'
; format for printing individual log entries to the console
