\section{Remote Spawning of Actors \experimental}
\label{remote-spawn}

Remote spawning is an extension of the dynamic spawn using run-time type names
\see{add-custom-actor-type}. The following example assumes a typed actor handle
named \lstinline^calculator^ with an actor implementing this messaging
interface named "calculator".

\cppexample[125-143]{remoting/remote_spawn}

We first connect to a CAF node with \lstinline^middleman().connect(...)^. On
success, \lstinline^connect^ returns the node ID we need for
\lstinline^remote_spawn^. This requires the server to open a port with
\lstinline^middleman().open(...)^ or \lstinline^middleman().publish(...)^.
Alternatively, we can obtain the node ID from an already existing remote actor
handle---returned from \lstinline^remote_actor^ for example---via
\lstinline^hdl->node()^. After connecting to the server, we can use
\lstinline^middleman().remote_spawn<...>(...)^ to create actors remotely.
