// A work-around the problem that for static libraries unused globals
// aren't linked into the final binary. CMake automatically inserts
// code here to reference the globals that initializes each of the
// statically compiled plugins.
//
// Note: This won't be necessary anymore once we can assume CMake >2.8.8
// as a required depencendy. If so, switch bro_HAVE_OBJECT_LIBRARIES
// in src/CMakeLists.txt to TRUE and remove this.
